# Stewart Platform

This repo contains the files necessary to build and control a Stewart platform.

# Getting Started

This code uses:

- Ubuntu 14.04

- ROS Indigo

### Setup the ROS Environment 

Install ROS indigo if you haven't already: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

Setup environment variables:
```
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
```

Setup the workspace:
```
mkdir -p ~/stewart_ws/src
cd ~/stewart_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```
### Install ROS Dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino ros-indigo-rosserial ros-indigo-rosserial-server python-catkin-tools
```

### Clone this repo into the catkin workspace

```
cd ~/stewart_ws/src
git clone <https://address>
mv advancedrobotics/ stewart_platform/
```

### Build this workspace

```
cd ~/stewart_ws
mkdir src/stewart_platform/include
catkin build
source ~/stewart_ws/devel/setup.bash
sudo cp ~/stewart_ws/src/stewart_platform/dev_rules/*.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm trigger
roscd stewart_platform/
```

Make sure to unplug and replug the usb devices after running udevadm trigger.

### Setup the environment variables to be sourced on startup

```
sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
```

Add these 2 lines at the bottom:
```
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source ~/stewart_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

# Running the Stewart Platform

Install Dynamixel Dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-dynamixel-motor
```

Make sure roscore is running. If not, run this command in a separate terminal:
```
roscore
```

In a new terminal, bring up the dynamixel servos:
```
roslaunch stewart_platform controller_manager.launch
```

Then, you can run the start the main node:
```
rosrun stewart_platform stewart.py
```

That script accepts different options, and you may first want to test that the servos are working well by passing the `test` argument:
```
rosrun stewart_platform stewart.py test
```
You should see the motors move to the min range, max range, and then a neutral position when running this test. If they don't move, but you don't have any errors, try restarting everything. If you have errors, good luck!

If you want to manually control the pose, launch the following node:
```
rosrun stewart_platform controller.py
```

### Communication with Sparkfun Razor 9DOF IMU

```
rosrun stewart_platform stewart_accel_test
```

A [Razor](https://github.com/ptrbrtz/razor-9dof-ahrs/wiki/Tutorial) tutorial. Use this tutorial to calibrate the Razor.

**NOTE** Yaw will not be correct if the magnetometer is not set up properly.

You can view the data in a serial monitor tool, such as Arduino or PuTTy. 
#### To use Arduino:
Install arduino from webpage, not distro.

`rosserial_arduino` Tutorials are [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials)

Start Arduino

Change the Serial Port to the one that the Sparkfun Razor is plugged into by navigating to and changing Tools -> Serial Port -> /dev/ttyUSB#

Navigate to Tools -> Serial Monitor

Change the baud rate to 57600

You should see scrolling data that changes when you move the IMU around and that looks similar to:
```
#YPR=-157.65,2.94,-0.14
#YPR=-157.67,2.95,-0.15
#YPR=-157.69,2.95,-0.14
#YPR=-157.72,2.96,-0.13
...
```


## Windows Dynamixel Manager
download the [RoboPlus software](http://en.robotis.com/BlueAD/board.php?bbs_id=downloads&mode=view&bbs_no=1132559&page=1&key=&keyword=&sort=&scate=SOFTWARE) from dynamixel

see [this page](http://learn.trossenrobotics.com/34-blog/140-ftdi-2-12-00-notice-robotis-usb2dynamixel-cm-530-and-ln-101-october-2014.html) for driver installation problems

Use the Dynamixel wizard to set up the servos. 2, 4, 6 need to be in the reverse direction mode. The files in this package assume the communication baud rate is (0x34) 57600.


# Hardware Build Notes

* Remember to wire up the servos before installing them
* Add a laser cut hole to bottom of servo stands for easer cable routing
* Ensure servo horns are aligned to the zero position.
* Make all bars the same length and command servos to same position before installing the upper plate.
